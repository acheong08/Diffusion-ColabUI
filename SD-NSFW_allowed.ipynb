        "- v0.1: Colab creation\n",
        "- v0.11: Google Drive option for TXT2IMG and some error corrections\n",
        "- v0.12: Added more options to TXT2IMG\n",
        "- v0.13: Diffusers added a feature which broke the pipeline with the current implementation, reverted back to an older version\n",
        "- v0.14: Added in full precision in the diffuser method\n",
        "- v0.15: Added in file saving in drive for diffusers\n",
        "- v0.16: Added in prompt saving\n",
        "- v0.17: Added in the new weights and disabled the NSFW check\n",
        "- v0.18: Minor adjustments and more details saved in prompt saving\n",
        "- v0.19: Added in modifier experiments in Diffusers + example. More options to experiment will come with future updates\n",
        "- v0.20: Low VRAM patch is fixed. Getting 10 it/s with it on with a V100\n",
        "- v0.21: Diffusers now has an upscaler (Real-ESRGAN) <-- just updated to GFPGAN\n",
        "- v0.22: Added in a small little fun randomizer\n",
        "- v0.23: Now I support both upscalers. GFP is really good at faces but kind of sucks at upscaling. If you want the best of two worlds choose \"Both\" as an upscaler. T4 may have problems with one or both of them, looking at a fix for that (May get lucky with Real-ESRGAN).\n",
        "- v0.30: A complete code overhaul by WAS#0263 and a bunch of stuff added. With an overhaul, there could also different bugs. Shoot me ( NOP#1337 ) a discord message when you find one and tell WAS that he is awesome when you see him! If there are major bugs, I'll fix them as soon as I can\n",
        "- v0.31: Forgot to mention last update: No more huggingface login, that's all built-in now. Also, we have new facial enhancement. --> CodeFormer. It's like GFP but not as strong + with a nifty slider\n",
        "- v0.32: Added options for samplers (still having problems with other ones). Also added an option to sharpen the image.\n",
        "- v0.33: Added ddim & ETA for DDIM. Also trying to dim down some more VRAM\n",
        "- v0.34: Merged setup into the render cell.\n",
        "- v0.35: Just some backend stuff. Will behave differently, don't be alarmed. Sometimes VRAM got stuck and this should fix it. Also added a 'SKIP_PREVIEW' button to see if this can fix connectivity issues after running the colab.\n",
        "- v0.36: IMG2IMG (inits) are now available. If you like drawing, then turn on USE_INIT and empty out INIT_IMAGE\n",
        "- v0.37: Better drawing feature if no init image is provided\n",
        "- v0.38: Added options for weights and diffuser versions\n",
        "- v0.39: Added a (bad) first integration of inpainting. Plans are to have a full-on editor for masks similarly to img2img/init. You need to run diffusers first in order to set up the environment though. When you are done, make sure to clean up the vram in order to help prevent Out Of Memory errors\n",
        "- v0.4: Inpainting now supported within the main diffusers cell. Additionally, if there is no mask image provided, you can draw your own within the colab (Mobile unfortunately not supported YET)\n",
        "- v0.41: Added a `VRAM_OVER_SPEED` implementation that is based on a discussion in the diffusers Github. Checking this option will prioritize VRAM usage over creation speed. That being said, haven't tested it extensively\n",
        "- v0.42: added waifu as a model thanks to Alamgir#1781. Use at your own risk, haven't tested it. If you want to use it, just select it under `MODEL_ID`. It is trained on danbooru data therefore if you want to generate an anime character with a japanese name its better to put the last name first ((Since this is 0.42 does that mean that Waifu is the meaning of life?)))\n",
